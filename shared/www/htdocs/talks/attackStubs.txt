  state
    goal: stop being in state without traversing a transition
      attack the DFD elements that control this state
        create, read, or update data on a data flow
	create, read, or update data on a data store
	cause a process to remove this state
	cause the process that checks for the state to report the absence of the state
	cause a legitimate actor to change this state
