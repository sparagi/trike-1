<p>Trike is a personal project of Brenda Larcom and Eleanor Saitta, and hopefully other individual developers in the future.  Both Brenda and Ella currently work for <a href="http://www.stachliu.com/">Stach & Liu</a>, which graciously allows the free flow of ideas to and from Trike and occasionally even funds some documentation or bug fixing, but does not control Trike.</p>
