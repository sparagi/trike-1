[19:08] <asparagi> psst, anybody there?
[19:09] <asparagi> the house i might be interested in has pictures & a yard size now.  it sounds perfect -- the house is about half the size of danger house & the yard is twice as big.  it is still on the market, and i'm going to go see it friday

[19:10] <asparagi> the colors don't even look too bad
[19:11] <asparagi> i find it amusing that it looks like a double wide.  i am starting to hope i might get it, perhaps even for a good price (less than they are asking)
[19:11] <asparagi> hee hee :)
[19:21] <Dymaxion> woot!
[19:22] <Dymaxion> looks good
