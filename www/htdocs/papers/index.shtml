    <dd class="abstract"><p>
Trike is a unified conceptual framework for security auditing
from a risk management perspective through the generation
of threat models in a reliable, repeatable manner. A security auditing team can use it to completely and accurately
describe the security characteristics of a system from its high-level architecture to its low-level implementation details. Trike
also enables communication among security team members and
between security teams and other stakeholders by providing a
consistent conceptual framework. This document describes the
current version of the methodology (currently under heavy development) in sufficient detail to allow its use. In addition to
detail on the threat model itself (including automatic threat
generation and attack graphs), we cover the two models used
in its generation, namely the requirements model and the implementation model, along with notes on risk analysis and
work flows. The final version of this paper will include a fully
worked example for the entire process. Trike is distinguished
from other threat modeling methodologies by the high levels
of automation possible within the system, the defensive perspective of the system, and the degree of formalism present in
the methodology. Portions of this methodology are currently
experimental; as they have not been fully tested against real
systems, care should be exercised when using them.
