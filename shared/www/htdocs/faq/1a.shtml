<p>The goal of the Trike tool is to automate the repetitive parts of threat modeling, so that all an analyst has to do is analyze the system, i.e. think.  Since it's the Trike tool, we're using <a href="/papers">the Trike methodology</a>'s view of what is automatable and what requires thinking.  Mostly, this means Trike automatically generates threats (and some attacks) based on a description of the system, but to get this, you have to describe the system to Trike and check out whether these threats & attacks apply.  In general, later versions of the tool automate more than earlier versions.  Different versions may try automating things in different ways, or with drastically different human interfaces.</p>
<p>One often noticed feature of Trike is that the model is live.  When you update part of the model, you see changes to the affected parts of the model right away -- no need to press a button to recalculate.</p>
