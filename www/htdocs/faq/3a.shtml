<p>Good question.  We don't have a specific date yet.  We do not plan to make another release based on the v1 methodology.  We are actively coding for the first release for the v2 methodology, which we intend to be a Real Tool, vs. a prototype.  Mainly, this means being able to read the files we write out (so that analysts can work together on models like normal people), and that we will write some documentation so you can actually use it.  Since v1, we've learned even better ways to think about nearly every aspect of threat modeling, which means we are rewriting nearly every part of the back end code.  We've also found a less buggy and troublesome set of UI widgets, which means we are rewriting nearly every part of the UI.  Finally, we're doing all this in our spare time.  The earliest you should expect to see a v2 tool is Q1 2009.</p>
