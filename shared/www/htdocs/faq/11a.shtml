<p>The first, most important thing to do is <a href="/contact.shtml">contact us</a>.  Send us links to interesting papers, or (relevant :) ) ideas you had in the shower this morning, or feedback on our papers.  Try our tool and tell us what you like and don't like (be specific, so we have a chance to improve).  File some bugs or feature requests.  Join our developer mailing list.  If you know or want to learn Smalltalk, try your hand at fixing some bugs (it would probably be least frustrating for you to announce on the IRC channel that you are about to do this, so we can be helpful).  If you like to live on the edge, ask to be one of our early testers, and use early Trike pre-releases.   If you are working on a related tool and would like to interoperate with us, we would love to interoperate with you; please contact us so we can work out the details.</p>
