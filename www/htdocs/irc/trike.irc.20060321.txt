[17:03] <Dymaxion> where do we want to meet today?
[17:04] <Dymaxion> I think if we're going to try the whole pair programming thing, we should be in the same place.
[17:05] <Dymaxion> My place is an option, and last we talked, it sounded like your place was too... or we could try that new place you mentioned
[21:23] <ar4chne> what about if you and brenda do a methodology meeting
[21:24] <ar4chne> since we didn't have one last week
[21:24] <ar4chne> and I spend the night studying? :>
[21:24] <ar4chne> for my interview tomorrow
[21:24] <ar4chne> I'm a bit nervous
[21:25] <Dymaxion> you sure?  I think you'll do fine.
[21:26] <Dymaxion> I mean, if you want to, that's cool, of courge
[21:26] <Dymaxion> course
[21:29] <ar4chne> yeah, I'd rather :>
[21:29] <ar4chne> otherwise I'm just going to be preoccupied
[21:29] <Dymaxion> ok
[21:29] <Dymaxion> yeah
[21:29] <Dymaxion> good luck with the studying!
[21:30] <Dymaxion> and the interview, too
[21:41] <ar4chne> thanks :)
[21:42] <ar4chne> brenda just called, said she's sorry to be late and that she's going to call you!
[21:43] <Dymaxion> Thanks just heard from her
