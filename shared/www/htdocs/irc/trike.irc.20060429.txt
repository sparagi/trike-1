[21:07] <Dymaxion> hey
[21:23] <asparagi> hey!
[21:24] <asparagi> i'm working on finishing URI & some classes to support it
[21:24] <asparagi> i started trying to get the xml namespace tests y'all started writing to be tests & run & stuff
[21:25] <asparagi> it looks like the xml parser isn't very extensible to do what I wanted
[21:25] <asparagi> but fortunately it's not too big either
[21:26] <asparagi> so i'm going to finish URI, then use the character encoding classes I wrote for it to fix the XML implementation
[21:27] <Dymaxion> yay
[21:27] <Dymaxion> cool
[22:30] <ar4chne> nifty, aspa
